# Tweepy-OpenAI-Bot
A Twitter bot that uses OpenAI's API to generate a specified number of "Motivational Tweets" and tweets the once per hour.

NOTE: This is a personal project and is likely buggy and not written very well as of right now.

#Whats Next?
I plan to intergrate this into a Django web application to be run locally.
